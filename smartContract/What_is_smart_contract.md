It is increasing the efficiency of our social structure by each passing day.

Let's comparet the smart contract with vending machines. In the real world, after inserting 10 dollars and press button, you will get the thing like potato chips which you expected. In the smart contract, you drop some digital coin and data, you will get the expected outcome, e.g. driver licence, into your own account.
