## NEO Tutorial

NEO Tutorial is designed as an onboarding tool for developers or other individuals that wish to become more familiar with the internal functions of NEO, such as how addresses are generated, how blocks are created and validated, and how dBFT operates.

It should be noted that this version of NEO Tutorial is applicable only to NEO 2.x, the current version of the NEO MainNet. Large changes are expected during the transition to NEO3, at which point an updated tutorial will be created.
